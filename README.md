# Blog
## Overview
This is a portfolio project showcasing a blog that is built on both MVC and REST API designs. The whole application is built using ASP.NET Core 5.0 with MS SQL as the persistant database. It also has Create, Read, Update and Delete features.

To demonstrate the working knowledge of MVC and API designs, the front end and back end of the blog are split into 2 projects. The front end is design with ASP.NET Core MVC Web App. The MVC Web App then consume data from ASP.NET Core 5 REST API. The designs follow the onion architecture with separation of concerns and inversion of control principles in mind.

Unit testing is implemented on both MVC and API. The comment feature of the blog were added using Test Driven Development (TDD) approach.

## Files structure
The solution is organised into 5 different projects and library classes
1. Blog (MVC Web App)
2. WebAPI (REST API)
3. Data (Data related assets - Entities model, Migrations, DbContext, Repositories)
4. Domain (Utilities and business logic classes)
5. BlogTest (Unit Testing)

Please note that Data and Domain library classes are separated from the projects so that the assets can be shared between the projects without affecting each other if one project is being retired.
